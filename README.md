# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://connerardman.github.io/Main-Course/>

This project is a mobile-first web application aimed at making the cooking process easier.
A user simply inputs their meal preferences, and we generate a new list of recipes for
them to use for the day as well as a shopping list to take to the grocery store.
