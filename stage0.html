      <h1>UW Student Productivity Tools</h1>

      <h2>Topic Description</h2>
      <p>
        As a student at UW, I find that there is a clear gap in applications to help
        with various tasks that students constantly do. Moreover, the ones that do exist
        tend to not be written with a student first approach, and thus they have poor
        user experiences and adoption. The problem area is pretty broad, but essentially
        I want to build a tool to help optimize student life at UW (or potentially more
        broadly, but I think broadening the scope could take away from the user
        experience). To make it more concrete, the primary areas of interest to me is
        building tools that help students succeed in their classes. To do so, I think
        there are a few more specific areas that can be addressed - the cost of text
        books (some students just don't buy them putting them at a disadvantage),
        optimizing course schedules, and forming study groups and other relationships (I
        think having a solid social life is really important in succeeding
        academically).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this area is particularly important to address at UW, because our
        competitive major system is not very forgiving to students that have a hard time
        adjusting to college life. For this reason, I think helping students form those
        initial relationships, develop good strategies for success in class and
        providing access to the necessary resources to learn is incredibly important and
        an area for improvement.

      <h2>Potential Apps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Book Exchange</strong>
          - Students by textbooks every quarter, just to sell them back to the bookstore
          for half of the money. The idea is pretty simple, input what books you have and
          the classes you plan to take. The system would match you with students that have
          the books you need and need the books you have. Hypothetically, this could mean
          only ever buying books for one quarter.<br>

        <li>
          <strong>Find Nearest Courses</strong>
          - A lot of students don't go to class because they are too far away (especially
          in winter quarter). This app would use Google maps and course requirements to
          find a schedule that optimizes for the least amount of walking. Additionally,
          this could be helpful for students with mobility related disabilities that have
          trouble getting to classes on time.<br>
          <a
            href="https://webcpm.com/articles/2015/08/06/why-college-students-skip-class.aspx">
            Students typically cite being too tired as a reason for not going to class.
            Helping shorten commute to classes (and between them) could help prevent this.
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Find Students With Similar Schedules</strong>
          - The idea here is pretty simple. Students would input what classes they are
          taking and it could form groups within those classes. I think this could be
          especially helpful for freshen taking large introductory courses (think CSE 142)
          to form study groups and create a smaller environment inside those large
          classes.<br>
