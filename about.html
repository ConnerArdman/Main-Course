         <h2>About Cook Healthy</h2>
         <p>
            The original idea here was to create an application that would somehow make the
            lives of students easier. As a student myself, I found that I was constantly
            eating out, because I was running out of ideas of what to make. As a result, I
            was spending more money than I wanted to on food. To solve this problem, I
            created Cook Healhty, an application to help create a
            <strong>cheap daily meal plan</strong>. The idea is pretty simple, you can add
            filters based on nutritional goals, and Cook Healthy will
            automatically create a customized plan with recipes and a weekly shopping cart
            to bring to the grocery story.
         </p>

         <h2>Some Limitations</h2>
         <p>
            The orginal goal here was to allow a budget to be part of the filters,
            and to provide an entire weeks worth of recipes. Additionally, the original
            wireframe contained a few more filters. Unfortunately, limitations of the API
            are preventing this currently. There is a great deal of rate limiting happening
            from the API, preventing the site from gathering all of the information it needs.
            Additionally, I wanted to show the actual recipe on the screen, but this is another
            limitation of the free version of this API.
         </p>

         <h2>About The Development</h2>
         <p>
            For this site, I chose to utlize the Less CSS extension, as it allowed
            me to create simple variables that control the look and feel of the
            site. Changing any of the variables at the top of the Less file should
            substantially change the look of the site. Additionally, I built this
            initial version with a mobile first approach, meaning all of the default
            styles are for smaller devices. That said, the CSS should scale nicely
            on a larger screen in a multi-column format.
         </p>
         <p>
            In addition to the CSS, I wrote some basic JavaScript functions to add
            to the aesthetic and usability of the page. These functions are listening
            for the screen size to change, in order to change the logic for expanding
            and compressing the filters section. Additionally, this JavaScript serves to
            keep track of the changes made on the sliders and display them to the user.
            As a note, Chrome's mobile simulator blocks these sliders, but they work
            perfectly on <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=range" target="_blank">most mobile devices.</a>
