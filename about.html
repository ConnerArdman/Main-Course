         <h2>About Cook Cheap</h2>
         <p>
            The original idea here was to create an application that would somehow make the
            lives of students easier. As a student myself, I found that I was constantly
            eating out, because I was running out of ideas of what to make. As a result, I
            was spending more money than I wanted to on food. To solve this problem, I
            created Cook Cheap, an application to help create a
            <strong>cheap weekly meal plan</strong>. The idea is pretty simple, you can add
            filters based on a weekly budget and nutritional goals, and Cook Cheap will
            automatically create a customized plan with recipes and a weekly shopping cart
            to bring to the grocery story.
         </p>

         <h2>Future Plans</h2>
         <p>
            As of now, this page is just loading hard-coded sample data. In the future, I
            plan to connect with a recipe API to dynamically choose what recipes to show to
            a user. Additionally, I want to implement functionality for users to further
            customize their plan after having it load. For example, they could decide that
            they don't like a particular recipe and remove it. In this case, the program
            would then recommend a new recipe to replace it.
         </p>

         <h2>About The Development</h2>
         <p>
            For this site, I chose to utlize the Less CSS extension, as it allowed
            me to create simple variables that control the look and feel of the
            site. Changing any of the variables at the top of the Less file should
            substantially change the look of the site. Additionally, I built this
            initial version with a mobile first approach, meaning all of the default
            styles are for smaller devices. That said, the CSS should scale nicely
            on a larger screen in a multi-column format.
         </p>
         <p>
            In addition to the CSS, I wrote some basic JavaScript functions to add
            to the aesthetic and usability of the page. These functions are listening
            for the screen size to change, in order to change the logic for expanding
            and compressing the filters section. Lastly, this JavaScript serves to
            keep track of the changes made on the sliders and display them to the user.
