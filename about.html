         <h2>About Cook Cheap</h2>
         <p>
            The original idea here was to create an application that would somehow make the
            lives of students easier. As a student myself, I found that I was constantly
            eating out, because I was running out of ideas of what to make. As a result, I
            was spending more money than I wanted to on food. To solve this problem, I
            created Cook Cheap, an application to help create a
            <strong>weekly meal plan</strong>. The idea is pretty simple, you can add
            filters based on a weekly budget and nutritional goals, and Cook Cheap will
            automatically create a customized plan with recipes and a weekly shopping cart
            to bring to the grocery story.

         <h2>Future Plans</h2>
         <p>
            As of now, this page is just loading hard-coded sample data. In the future, I
            plan to connect with a recipe API to dynamically choose what recipes to show to
            a user. Additionally, I want to implement functionality for users to further
            customize their plan after having it load. For example, they could decide that
            they don't like a particular recipe and remove it. In this case, the program
            would then recommend a new recipe to replace it.
